## Milestone Progress

### Milestone 0: CLI + Config + Validation (Foundation)

**Status**: 🟡 ~40% Complete  
**Priority**: Critical

#### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] `init` command (create default config)
- [x] Basic config schema (TOML structures)
- [x] Config parsing (TOML deserialization)
- [x] `print-config` command (colored display)
- [x] Basic directory management (`~/.neatd`)

#### In Progress 🟡
- [ ] `validate` command (basic parsing works, needs field-level diagnostics)
- [ ] Enhanced config schema (conflict strategies, metadata constraints)

#### Not Started ❌
- [ ] Path validation (existence, readability)
- [ ] Glob pattern validation
- [ ] Rule priority validation
- [ ] Configuration schema documentation (CONFIG.md) - ✅ Documented but not validated in code

#### In Progress 🟡
- [ ] Scanner implementation (exists but has issues)
  - Scanner has bugs (wrong variable usage, recursion issues)
  - Missing proper error handling
  - No inventory collection/output

- [ ] Ignore hidden files
- [ ] Ignore directories list
- [ ] Ignore extensions (case-insensitive)
- [ ] Ignore globs
- [ ] Symlink policy (skip/follow/record)
- [ ] Exclude short-circuit (partially exists but needs work)
