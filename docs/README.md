# neatd Documentation

This directory contains high-level design and architecture documentation for the neatd application.

## Documentation Index

### [HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md](./HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md)
Comprehensive high-level design document covering:
- Overview and purpose
- System architecture
- Core components and their responsibilities
- Data flow diagrams
- Configuration schema
- Module structure
- Safety features
- Future considerations

**Recommended for**: New developers, architects, and anyone wanting a complete understanding of the system.

### [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
Detailed architecture documentation with:
- System architecture diagrams
- Component interaction flows
- Data structure hierarchies
- Algorithms (rule matching, policy resolution)
- Error handling model
- State management concepts

**Recommended for**: Developers implementing features, debugging, or understanding system behavior.

### [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](./DESIGN_DECISIONS.md)
Architectural decision records (ADRs) explaining:
- Why specific technologies were chosen (TOML, etc.)
- Design trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Rationale behind key architectural choices
- Implementation patterns and their reasoning

**Recommended for**: Developers making changes, code reviewers, and future maintainers.

## Quick Navigation

- **Getting Started**: Start with [HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md](./HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md) Section 1 (Overview)
- **Understanding the Codebase**: Read [HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md](./HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md) Section 6 (Module Structure)
- **Understanding Data Flow**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) Section "Component Interaction Flow"
- **Making Changes**: Review [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](./DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) for context on existing decisions

## Document Maintenance

These documents should be updated when:
- Major architectural changes are made
- New components are added
- Significant design decisions are made
- Configuration schema changes
- New features are added that change system behavior
