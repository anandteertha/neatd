### Story 3.3: Collision Detection

**ID**: EPIC3-3  
**Title**: Detect Destination Collisions  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: EPIC3-2

**Description**:
Detect when multiple operations would result in the same destination path.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement collision detection algorithm
- [ ] Group operations by destination
- [ ] Identify collisions (multiple operations → same destination)
- [ ] Create collision records
- [ ] Include all conflicting operations in collision
- [ ] Test collision detection
- [ ] Test with various collision scenarios
- [ ] Performance test (should be efficient)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All collisions are detected
- Collision records are accurate
- Performance is acceptable
- Edge cases handled
