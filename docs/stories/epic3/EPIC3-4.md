### Story 3.4: Cycle Detection

**ID**: EPIC3-4  
**Title**: Detect Circular Move Operations  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: EPIC3-2

**Description**:
Detect cycles in move operations (e.g., moving file A to location B, and file B to location A).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement cycle detection algorithm
- [ ] Build dependency graph of operations
- [ ] Detect cycles in graph
- [ ] Mark operations involved in cycles
- [ ] Report cycles in plan
- [ ] Test cycle detection
- [ ] Test with various cycle scenarios
- [ ] Test with complex cycles

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All cycles are detected
- Cycle reports are accurate
- Performance is acceptable
