**ID**: EPIC3-7  
**Title**: Order Operations for Safe Execution  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: EPIC3-6

**Description**:
Order operations to ensure safe execution (e.g., create directories before moving files into them).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement operation ordering algorithm
- [ ] Identify dependencies (directory creation before moves)
- [ ] Topological sort operations
- [ ] Handle cycles (shouldn't happen after resolution, but handle)
- [ ] Group operations by type
- [ ] Order groups appropriately
- [ ] Test operation ordering
- [ ] Test with complex scenarios
- [ ] Verify ordering is correct

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Operations are ordered correctly
- Dependencies are respected
- Execution order is safe
- Performance is acceptable
